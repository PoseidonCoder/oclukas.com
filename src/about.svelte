        <h2>Tech</h2>
        <p>
            I love everything related to technology; from hardware to software.
            I believe that computers were mans greatest invention.
            I've dabbled with Linux, a multitude of programming languages, open-source, and Rasberry Pi.

        <h2>School</h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently a student at a school that hasn't handled distanced learning very well.
            However, one of my greatest weaknesses at this school is procrastination.
